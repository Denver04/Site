# Site

hehehe, this is my website in which I've used the backend + frontend. It is a simple "About" website where user can login and see their register details. It only show the profile.

 
In this I have used Express , MongoDB , passport , NodeJs for backend and authentication. And HTML, CSS, and BootStrap for frontend.

Hope you like this :)
